# Game of collisions

web: https://moniak11.github.io/collisions/

The project follows a group of balls that live according to the following rules: If the ball hits the edge, it splits. If two balls with initial color collide, they change color. If two colorful balls collide, they absorb each other. When a ball splits enough times, it disappears, and when it absorbs enough balls, it creates a new one. Will they keep moving, or will they all eventually disappear?


Instructions for control:



-Click on the canvas to create a new ball



-Move the cursor to deflect the moving balls



-Press ENTER to switch to full screen mode
